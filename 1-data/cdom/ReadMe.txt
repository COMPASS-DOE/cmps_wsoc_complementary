This folder and ReadMe were generated by Alan Roebuck on October 10, 2022

This folder contains absorbance and EEMs data for samples submitted by Kaizad Pated in September 2022. 
Samples were analyzed on the Aqualog by Julia McElhinny and Alan Roebuck 
A Pre- and Postrun standard (Tea) standard is provided for each day. All data for Tea standards is not DOC normalized.
All EEM samples were Blank Corrected, Dilution Corrected, Inner Filter Corrected and Raman Normalized (RSU). 

General Notes: 
Samples COMP21, 23, 25, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, and 45 all had considerably high Rayleigh scattering.Scatter removal was applied consistently across all samples. While this does not affect the current set of data, 
this may impact any PARAFAC modeling applied later. 
Samples COMP21, 23, 25, 41, 42, 43, and 45 all had high absorbance (>0.3 at 254 nm). Thus, these samples required
further dilution. These were diluted by an additional factor of 2. 


This folder contains the following files and folders. 

1) Absorbance - Contains all absorbance files for
2) Blanks - Contains all EEM blank files used for blank subtracting EEM samples.
3) Raw EEMs - This contains all raw EEMs to be processed. 
4) Corrected_EEMs - This folder contains all final EEMs that have been blank subtracted, dilution corrected, inner filter corrected,
and raman normalized. All units are in Raman Standard Units (RSU). This file will be required at a later date to be used for PARAFAC.
5) Figures - contains all EEM contour plots. For the purpose of these plots, all EEMs data was normalized to 1 mg/L DOC. Intesity units
are in RSU/DOC(mg/L)
6) Final_Data - contains individual CSV files that represent Spectral Indices, Corrected_RSU, and DOC normalized data. All Tea standards,
regardless of the tab they are in, are not DOC normalized as we have not not measured the DOC, thus an input of
1 mg/L was used to satisfy the needs of the code. In the Corrected_RSU folder, fluorescence peaks (A,C,M,T,B) are in units of RSU. Absorbance 
peaks (A250, A254, etc) are technically unitless, although often reported as Absorbance Units (AU). In the DOC normalized data, all data was 
divided by DOC concentration. Thus fluorescence peaks are in RSU/DOC(mg/L) and absorbance peaks are in AU/DOC(mg/L). 
7) Dil_Corrected_Absorbance - this folder contains dilution corrected absorbance spectra
8) Sample Log - contains all sample EEM information and pairings with respective absorbance and blanks.
Contains Sample Integration Time, Raman Normalization Factor, Dilution Factors, and DOC concentrations. Note that the code
raman corrects all EEMs based on the Raman Normalization Factor for a 1 second integration and the integration 
time for which the sample was ran.  


Update November 2, 2022 - Alan Roebuck

A folder called '8. PARAFAC' was added. This folder contains results from for a 4 component PARAFAC model generated from
this WSOC Lake Erie set of EEMs.  
Note that samples COMP11, COMP25, and COMP37 were removed as outliers from building the model due to high leverages.
Within this folder contains 3 figures. The Spectral Loadings provides a 2D graph displaying the Excitation and Emission loadings for each component. The 'fingerprint' is a 3D representation of these
loadings. The Split Validation is the results of a split validation test. In summary, the samples were split into 4 groups (A-D)
and then recombined to make 6 different pairings (AB, CD, AC, BD, AD, BC). Models were built for each pairing and then cross
compared against it's counterpart (e.g. AB vs CD) to form 3 different model comparisons. Cross validation of each pairing showed
that the components being generated in each model were all spectrally congruent and thus represented statistically comparable models.
This was the case for each of the 3 different model comparisons (e.g. AB vs CD, AC vs BD, and AD vs BC). 
These models were then cross validated with the orignal PARAFAC model derived from the entire dataset and found to 
be statistically congruent, thus implying a validated 4 component PARAFAC model.
The 4 components represent 1) Combined A/C 'humic-like' peak 2) M 'microbial humic-like' peak 3) D 'soil-derived' peak 
and 4) 'protein-like' T peak. See Wunsch et al., 2019 (doi: 10.1039/C8Ay02422G), Stedmon et al., 2003 
(doi: 10.1016/S0304-4203(03)00072-0), and references within.
Final Sample scores for each component can be found in the file 'COMPASS_LakeErie_WSOC_Sept2022_PARAFAC.xls'.
The tab 'Model4Report' contains various model parameters
The tab 'Model4Loading' contains sample scores only for samples used to build the model and the Excitation/Emission loadings for each component
The tab 'Model4FmaxProjected' contains samples scores for all samples plus those that were projected onto the outliers. These are the FINAL
sample data that should be transmitted for comparison to other analyses. If doing multivariate analyses, best to convert these to 
relative values (e.g %C1, %C2, %C3, %C4).
